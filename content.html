          <p class="paragraph">Happy 20th Birthday Invyyy!</p>
          <p>Wishing you all the best ahead with whatever you pursue. Hope you have a blast!</p>

          <p>Haven't seen you irl for some time now. Still waiting for you to drop me a visit here and treat me to lunch with your first salary! :P</p>

          <p>That said, thanks for being a great friend who I know will be there if I ever need someone. On top of everything, thank you for being the INVY you are; for being yourself. Never change who you are!</p>

          <p>Although we all need to live out our personal lives and may not interact as much as before, do know that if you ever need anything, you can always come and find me!!</p>
          <p class="ps">Cheers! - Chris :D | P.S. try clicking on your name if you haven't already done so. Enjoy~</p>
